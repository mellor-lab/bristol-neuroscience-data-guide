# Repository Management with Git
This page documents GIN repository management using [Git](https://git-scm.com/). As Git is a popular version control system, many of you may prefer to use it for managing your research data. GIN client is a Git wrapper and, therefore, Git can be used directly to interact with a GIN server.

This page will be rolled out in the future.
