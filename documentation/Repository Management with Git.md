# Repository Management with Git
This page documents GIN repository management using [Git](https://git-scm.com/). As Git is a popular version control system, many of you may prefer to use it for managing your research data. GIN client is a Git wrapper and, therefore, Git can be used directly to interact with a GIN server.

```{note}
This section is work in progress. Its development is not a priority at the moment as it largely overlaps with other repository management subsections in the Documentation chapter.
