# Welcome to Bristol Neuroscience Data Guide

This is the documentation to neuroscience research data management at the University of Bristol (UoB). This book is under construction. The full documentation is planned to be complete in Autumn. However, you can still browse this book while it is under development and submit any issues or comments you have on the [Github issues page of this book](https://github.com/dervinism/bristol-neuroscience-data-guide/issues).

In addition to data management practices, the book describes and documents a data sharing platform used by neuroscience teams at UoB called [Bristol GIN](intro-bristol-gin). This platform is, however, inaccessible yet as the university IT Services are currently installing it on a university server. It is expected to be launched around the same time as the completion of the [Bristol Neuroscience Data Guide](intro-bristol-neurodata-guide).
